                    Modules are the rough equivalent of a midterm. There are four modules that address different web coding techniques. Each will count for 10% of your final grade. The first module is done individually and meant to demonstrate each students coding abilities. The remaining modules are completed as a group and must be collaborative and cooperatively complete.
