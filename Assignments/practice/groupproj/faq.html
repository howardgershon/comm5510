      <div class='question' onclick="showMeTheMoney('q2')">How can I ship Sandy Crab Creamery Ice Cream?</div> <br>
      <div class='answer' id='q2'>Unfortunately, we don’t ship ice cream from our Headquarter office, but you can always call a Sandy Crab Creamery location near you (or near your destination) to speak to the owner or manager to see if shipping options are available.
        <br>Please be aware shipping ice cream can be expensive. It requires special insulated packaging using dry ice, must be sent via overnight shipping, and the person receiving it must be available to sign for it. All of this to ensure it’s received
        in good condition and as quickly as possible.
