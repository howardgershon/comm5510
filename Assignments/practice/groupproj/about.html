      <p>Our founders, Donald and Susan Sutherland, scoured the world in search of the perfect ice cream. Not surprisingly, they found not all ice cream is created equal. From traditional hard-packed ice cream to soft serve varieties, until Donald and Susan
        pursued their "Ice Cream Dream"– we were stuck with some pretty disappointing alternatives. But after 1988, and the opening of the first Cold Stone Creamery® in Tempe, Arizona, things changed. The Sutherlands fundamentally redefined ice cream
        and the world was never the same. Cold Stone Creamery ice cream is categorized by industry experts as "Super Premium." Our ice cream is better because we make it fresh every day in every store, which puts Cold Stone® completely in a class of its
        own.</p>

      <p>At Cold Stone Creamery, we are proud of our heritage as Ice Cream Innovators. This heritage is based on a tradition of continuously redefining plain old regular ice cream into something truly extraordinary. Around here, we call every ice cream we
        serve a "Creation" – because each one is a work of art. Freshly made, smooth, creamy ice cream blended on a frozen granite stone with endless combinations – fruits, nuts, candy, cookies, brownies – you can mix in to your heart’s content.</p>

      <p>We’re so proud of our redefinition of ice cream that we’re almost inclined to do away with the words "ice cream" altogether. Why not just call it Cold Stone?</p>
