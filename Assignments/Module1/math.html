      <h3> Math and Me </h3> <br>
      <p>
        My love affair with math started when I was young. I was very interested in the subject. Exploring the boundaries of what was being taught by my teachers. Somewhere in my teenage years I abandoned my passion for math for less substantials pursuits. Thankfully, when I returned to school in 2009 I revisited the subject and fell back in love. My interest in math lies in mainly in three separate camps: probalbilty and statistics, data analysis and visualization, and numerical analysis.

        There are two main groups of statisticians. There are those that subscribe to the Bayesian school of thought. The Bayesians are those that follow Bayes theorem and use conditional probabilities to include informations about prior observations. The second group are the Frequentists. These statisticians do not consider any previous information. Of these two camps, I find my self in the first camp; I am a Bayesian.

      <h3> Data Visualization </h3> <br>

        To me, data visualization is such an incredible form of art. From a beautiful representation of how the <a href='http://china.fathom.info/'>Chinese goverment is comprised</a> to the <a href='http://twitter.github.io/interactive/sotu2014/#p1'>live reporting of tweets during the State of the Union address</a> we have many examples of how abstract information can be aggregated and formed into an easily digestible image or interaction.  I have made a few <a href='http://cs6630.kansascitystandard.com'>data visualizatoins</a> myself. To the right is a donut chart composed of updating random values made with <a href='http://d3js.org'>D3.js</a>.
